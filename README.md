# Linear Classifier (Logistic Regression)



It's called __linear classifier__ because it produces decision boundaries which are linear in nature. So, the classification made by this classifier is linear only.
Figure below shows the structure of the classifier implemented for classifying the 28x28 MNIST data (i.e. images of hand-written digits).

Example of decision boundaries generated for separating 3 classes are illustrated below.
